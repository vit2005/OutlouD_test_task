You have a field with dynamically sized cards facing down.
At the start, the game briefly shows them for a couple of seconds, and then the player clicks on
a card, flips it, and then clicks on another card.
The goal is to match all the cards.
A hint button shuffles the cards and shows them again for a couple of seconds.
Additionally, you must implement a timer, win and lose conditions, create a menu, and
optionally add sounds and VFX. Briefly describe why you chose this implementation approach
(architecture).
Part two: write a storage system for game options. It should allow for various save
implementations.
The storage should be able to save in JSON, player prefs, and binary.
It's preferable to use Zenject: Dependency Injection.
When you finish, upload it to fit the repository and share it with us, please indicate how many
